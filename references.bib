	abstract = {A new computational method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation is described. Conventional methods for solving this problem rely on diagonalization of a Hamiltonian matrix or iterative numerical solutions of a time independent wave equation. The new method, in contrast, is based on the spectral properties of solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The method requires the computation of a correlation function 〈ψ(r, 0)| ψ(r, t)〉 from a numerical solution ψ(r, t). Fourier analysis of this correlation function reveals a set of resonant peaks that correspond to the stationary states of the system. Analysis of the location of these peaks reveals the eigenvalues with high accuracy. Additional Fourier transforms of ψ(r, t) with respect to time generate the eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for a one-dimensional asymmetric double well potential and for the two-dimensional Hénon-Heiles potential.}

Consequently, we ask how precisely did concepts and ideas from radiation theory define the creation of quantum mechanics? And why was it a quantum theory of mechanics and not a quantum theory of electrodynamics that was crafted in the years 1925/26? Following these questions, this paper provides a reading of the history of the old quantum theory from the perspective of radiation. We argue that both wave and matrix mechanics, while emerging from widely different trajectories, emerged as spin-offs from nascent, ultimately unsuccessful quantum theories of radiation. We discuss the epistemological implications of this development for the historical and philosophical analysis of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.}

	abstract = {The numerical prediction, theoretical analysis, and experimental verification of the phenomenon of wave packet revivals in quantum systems has flourished over the last decade and a half. Quantum revivals are characterized by initially localized quantum states which have a short-term, quasi-classical time evolution, which then can spread significantly over several orbits, only to reform later in the form of a quantum revival in which the spreading reverses itself, the wave packet relocalizes, and the semi-classical periodicity is once again evident. Relocalization of the initial wave packet into a number of smaller copies of the initial packet (‘minipackets’ or ‘clones’) is also possible, giving rise to fractional revivals. Systems exhibiting such behavior are a fundamental realization of time-dependent interference phenomena for bound states with quantized energies in quantum mechanics and are therefore of wide interest in the physics and chemistry communities. We review the theoretical machinery of quantum wave packet construction leading to the existence of revivals and fractional revivals, in systems with one (or more) quantum number(s), as well as discussing how information on the classical period and revival time is encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum. We discuss a number of one-dimensional model systems which exhibit revival behavior, including the infinite well, the quantum bouncer, and others, as well as several two-dimensional integrable quantum billiard systems. Finally, we briefly review the experimental evidence for wave packet revivals in atomic, molecular, and other systems, and related revival phenomena in condensed matter and optical systems.}

It retains the well-known caustic smoothing property of Gaussians. The off-center guiding of Gaussians can handle hard chaos and other highly nonlinear situations, where the van Vleck propagator, for example, has over 30 000 separate branches. }

	title = {Computer simulation by
	the quantum mechanical time-dependent wavepacket method, especially
	for atom/molecule-solid-surface interaction},
	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {Thermal energy atomic scattering (TEAS) on solid surfaces forms the basis of a useful experimental method for obtaining information  about the structure, disorder and phonon spectra of the solid surface.  The probe particles (usually He atoms) can spend a relatively long time near the solid surface in the interaction region.  The dynamics of the interaction processes cannot be investigated directly at present.  However, an appropriate physical model of the interaction fitted to the intensity distribution of the scattering may be suitable for use in investigating the interaction processes theoretically, by computer simulation.  The present work emphasizes this computer simulation method.  For an actual computer simulation, the detector region TEAS experimental method must be  appropriate.  Moreover a theoretical model for the TEAS (e.g. a one-particle quantum mechanical wavepacket model governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE)) and a numerical method for solving the TDSE are necessary.
	
	The state functions of the consecutive time steps provide enough information to produce an `animation' displaying the dynamics of the interaction processes.  An `animation' is a series of snapshots of e.g. the probability density function (PDF), taken in rapid succession. The sequence of these snapshots provides a `movie' of the PDF time evolution.
	
	Applications, physical models, numerical solution procedures and simulation techniques relating to the time-dependent wavepacket (TDWP) method are overviewed in the present contribution - especially for the case of TEAS and molecular beam scattering.  Several relevant applications of the TDWP method - in the case of TEAS - are discussed (to scattering on ordered, stepped and adsorbed surfaces, the intensity distribution as a function of transfer width, resonant adsorption and trapping, classical and quantum chaos, scattering from vibrating surfaces). Preliminary results on the quantum chaos in TEAS are presented for the first time.  The theoretical and computational background (the TDWP and coupled channel methods) as well as applications (to diffraction probability, sticking probability, dissociative adsorption, the steering effect, inelastic channels) of six-dimensional molecule/surface dynamics calculations are described.}

	abstract = {Dynamics of electron wave-packets is studied using the continuum Dirac model in a graphene geometric diode where the propagation of the wave packet is favored in certain direction due to the presence of geometric constraints. Clear rectification is obtained in the THz frequency range with the maximum rectification level of 3.25, which is in good agreement with recent experiments on graphene ballistic diodes. The rectification levels are considerably higher for systems with narrower channels. In this case, the wave packet transmission probabilities and rectification rate also strongly depend on the energy of the incident wave packet, as a result of the quantum nature of energy levels along such channels. These findings can be useful for fundamental understanding of the charge carrier dynamics in graphene geometry diodes.}

However, on the basis of an old calculation by Belinfante [Physica 6, 887 (1939)], it can be shown that the spin may be regarded as an angular momentum generated by a circulating flow of energy in the wave field of the electron. Likewise, the magnetic moment may be regarded as generated by a circulating flow of charge in the wave field. This provides an intuitively appealing picture and establishes that neither the spin nor the magnetic moment are ‘‘internal’’—they are not associated with the internal structure of the electron, but rather with the structure of its wave field. Furthermore, a comparison between calculations of angular momentum in the Dirac and electromagnetic fields shows that the spin of the electron is entirely analogous to the angular momentum carried by a classical circularly polarized wave.}",

The method is based on discretizing space and time on a grid, and using the Fourier method to produce both spatial derivatives, and second order differencing for time derivatives. The method conserves norm and energy, and preserves quantum mechanical commutation relations. One- and two-dimensional examples, where a comparison to analytic results is possible, are investigated.}

A 1D FFT-based 3D-FFT computational approach is used to solve the limited device memory issue. Moreover, to reduce the communication overhead between the CPU and GPU, we propose a 3D data-transposition method that converts the target 1D vector into a contiguous memory layout and improves data transfer efficiency. The transposed data are communicated between the host and device memories efficiently through the pinned buffer and multiple streams. We apply our method to various large-scale benchmarks and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art multicore CPU FFT library (i.e., fastest Fourier transform in the West [FFTW]) and a prior GPU-based 3D-FFT algorithm. Our method achieves a higher performance (up to 2.89 times) than FFTW; it yields more performance gaps as the data size increases. The performance of the prior GPU algorithm decreases considerably in massive-scale problems, whereas our method's performance is stable.}

WPs were injected from a simulated STM tip placed above one of the grains. Electronic structure of the GBs was calculated by ab-initio and tight-binding methods. Two main factors governing the energy dependence of the transport have been identified: the misorientation angle of the two adjacent graphene grains and the atomic structure of the GB. In case of an ordered GB made of a periodic repetition of pentagon−heptagon pairs, it was found that the transport at high and low energies is mainly determined by the misorientation angle, but the transport around the Fermi energy is correlated with the electronic structure of the GB. A particular line defect with zero misorientation angle Lahiri et al., behaves as a metallic nanowire and shows electron–hole asymmetry for hot electrons or holes. To generate disordered GBs, found experimentally in CVD graphene samples, a Monte-Carlo-like procedure has been developed. Results show a reduced transport for the disordered GBs, primarily attributed to electronic localized states caused by C atoms with only two covalent bonds.}

It can be applied to systems of interacting particles, allowing for realistic simulations of quantum mechanics of various experimental systems. One of the drawbacks of the method is that divergences in the numerical evolution occur rather easily in the presence of interactions, which necessitates a large number of evolution steps or imaginary time evolution. We present a generalized (GFDTD-Q) method for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation including interactions between the particles. The new scheme provides a more relaxed condition for stability when the finite difference approximations for spatial derivatives are employed, as compared with the original FDTD-Q scheme. We demonstrate our scheme by simulating the time evolution of a two-particle interaction Hamiltonian. Our results show that the generalized method allows for stable time evolutions, in contrast to the original FDTD-Q scheme which produces a divergent solution.}

Although this improvement increases the approximation order from two to three without any extra cost, the continuity order remains C0. In this paper, we go one step further showing that a C1 continuous triquadratic B-spline reconstruction and its analytic partial derivatives can be evaluated by taking only one more trilinear sample into account. Thus, our method is the first volume-resampling technique that is nearly as fast as trilinear interpolation combined with on-the-fly central differencing, but provides a higher-quality reconstruction together with a consistent analytic gradient calculation. Furthermore, we show that our fast evaluation scheme can also be adapted to the Mitchell-Netravali [MN88] notch filter, for which a fast GPU implementation has not been known so far.},

	abstract = {Since its discovery and isolation some 5 years ago, research on graphene has exploded. The sheets of carbon atoms, just one atom thick, exhibit a vast array of properties—mechanical, optical, and electrical—that make it an ideal test bed to probe fundamental problems in physics, as well as lending itself to a wide portfolio of applications. Geim (p. 1530), the discoverer of this remarkable material, reviews recent advances and discusses what other developments may be in store for this material. Graphene is a wonder material with many superlatives to its name. It is the thinnest known material in the universe and the strongest ever measured. Its charge carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have zero effective mass, and can travel for micrometers without scattering at room temperature. Graphene can sustain current densities six orders of magnitude higher than that of copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to gases, and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a benchtop experiment. This review analyzes recent trends in graphene research and applications, and attempts to identify future directions in which the field is likely to develop.}

Different types of graphene have been investigated by X-ray diffraction{,} atomic force microscopy{,} transmission electron microscopy{,} scanning tunneling microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The extraordinary electronic properties of single-and bi-layer graphenes are indeed most unique and unexpected. Other properties of graphene such as gas adsorption characteristics{,} magnetic and electrochemical properties and the effects of doping by electrons and holes are equally noteworthy. Interestingly{,} molecular charge-transfer also markedly affects the electronic structure and properties of graphene.

	abstract = {A new computational method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation is described. Conventional methods for solving this problem rely on diagonalization of a Hamiltonian matrix or iterative numerical solutions of a time independent wave equation. The new method, in contrast, is based on the spectral properties of solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The method requires the computation of a correlation function 〈ψ(r, 0)| ψ(r, t)〉 from a numerical solution ψ(r, t). Fourier analysis of this correlation function reveals a set of resonant peaks that correspond to the stationary states of the system. Analysis of the location of these peaks reveals the eigenvalues with high accuracy. Additional Fourier transforms of ψ(r, t) with respect to time generate the eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for a one-dimensional asymmetric double well potential and for the two-dimensional Hénon-Heiles potential.}

The methods are applicable to the propagation of high energy laser beams through the atmosphere in the presence of a horizontal wind and turbulence for most situations of interest. Possible cases are propagation of cw beams through stagnation zones, multi-pulse propagation, including the self-consistent treatment of pulse self-blooming, and propagation involving transonic slewing. The solution of the Maxwell wave equation in Fresnel approximation is obtained by means of a discrete Fourier transform method, which, surprisingly, gives excellent results for diffraction problems. The latter provide a stringent test for the accuracy of any solution method. Considerable use is also made of discrete Fourier transform methods in solving the hydrodynamic equations. The treatment of turbulence is based on the generation of random phase screens at each calculation step along the propagation path. In a time-dependent calculation the random phase screens can be either made to move with the wind at a given propagation position or generated anew for each successive time.},
