\section{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Balázs Csébfalvi, who has always been very supportive and open to my silly ideas. One such idea of mine was to begin to work on wave packet simulation.
I am immensely grateful for the work of Dr. Géza István Márk and Dr. Péter Vancsó as my supervisors and as first-hand sources about wave packet dynamics.
Without their help, this work wouldn't exist.
I would like to mention Dr. János Asbóth who recommended to look into the work of Dr. Géza I. Márk's work.
He gave the first quantitative impulse to this research.
