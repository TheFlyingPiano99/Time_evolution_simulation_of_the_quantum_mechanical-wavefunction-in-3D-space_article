\section{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Balázs Csébfalvi, who has always been very supportive!
This work would also not be possible without the advise of Dr. János Asbóth, who suggested to look into the work of Dr. Géza I. Márk.
Finally I am very grateful for Dr. Géza I. Márk's work in the field of wave function simulation.
